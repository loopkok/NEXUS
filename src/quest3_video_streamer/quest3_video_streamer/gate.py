"""Runtime push gate for the Quest 3 video streamer.

The configured camera set (and therefore the negotiated WebRTC track set) is
fixed at startup — changing it would require SDP renegotiation.  The gate
instead decides, per track and at frame granularity, whether a track sends
camera frames or 2 fps black frames ("muted": near-zero bandwidth, the Quest
panel goes black, and un-muting resumes instantly with no reconnect).

Control surface (handled by the ROS node, see streamer_node.py):
  * ``push_enabled`` master switch — false mutes every track.
  * ``active`` label set — ``None`` means "all configured cameras stream";
    otherwise only the listed labels stream.

Both the rclpy spin thread (service/topic callbacks) and the asyncio WebRTC
thread (frame reads) touch the gate, so all state is behind a lock.
